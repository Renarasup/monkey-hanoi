Play the classic game of Towers of Hanoi - now with monkeys! In this game you must move the tower of monkeys from the first tree stump to the last tree stump. Whats the catch? The monkeys must be placed in order, from the largest at the bottom, to the smallest at the top. A large monkey cannot be moved on top of a smaller monkey. 

You can choose between 3 and 7 monkeys to play with on iPhone 5 (up to 5 monkeys on iPhone 4S and below). The more monkeys you choose, the harder the challenge. 

Try do it in as few moves as possible, and as fast as you can, then challenge your friends in Game Centre.
